\title{Produces multiple transformations of age term for fractional polynomial
analysis.}
\usage{
dh.makeAgePolys(
  df = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{df}{opal dataframe}

\item{age_var}{the age variable to transform}

\item{conns}{connections object for DataSHIELD backends}

\item{poly_form}{a vector of powers by which to transform the age variable}

\item{poly_names}{a vector of names for the created variables, the same length
and order as poly_form}

\item{checks}{Boolean. Whether or not to perform checks prior to running function. Default is TRUE.}

\item{agevars}{Retired argument name. Please use `new_obj' instead.}
}
\value{
transformations of age created in df
}
\description{
When we do trajectory analyses using fractional polynomials we often want
to try models with different combinations of age polynomials. This function
creates the following age transformations in datashield: age^-2, age^-1,
age^-0.5, log(age), age^0.5, age^2, age^3.
